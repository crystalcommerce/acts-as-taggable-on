** acts-as-taggable-on version 2.4.0

Hello! This version is the first one released by me (@tilsammans),
a new maintainer on the project. It's been a while since the last
release and I am not 100% sure if any breaking changes have been
introduced. Please test your tagging functionality carefully.

From now on things should stabilize. Please check the project's
milestones and compatibilities stated in the readme. If you have
any questions, feel free to create an issue on github.
